These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## set up
  - run `nvm use` to set your node version to v20

## how to run
  - run `npm run <day>` where `<day>` is the name of a directory in the repository
    - e.g. `npm run day01`

## test suite
  - run the tests with `npm run test`
